# argmin-core: argmin optimization toolbox core

This crate contains the core functionality of [argmin](http://argmin-rs.org).
If you just want to run an optimization method, this is *not* what you are looking for.
However, if you want to implement your own solver based on the argmin architecture, you should find all necessary tools here.
